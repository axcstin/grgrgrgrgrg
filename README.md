# Roblox-FPS-Unlocker
(OFFICIAL) FPS Unlocker for Roblox

•  Updated signatures for August 2023 Roblox update
•  Added Alt-Enter Fix setting, which sets the FFlagHandleAltEnterFullscreenManually flag in ClientAppSettings.json
•  Added Revert Flags on Close advanced setting (default on), which will reset any flags written by RFU to their default values upon exit
•  Bugfix: Toggling off Unlock Roblox Player or Unlock Roblox Studio will reset the FPS caps of previously attached processes

REMINDER: Use of the Memory Write unlock mode with Roblox's Hyperion-protected client is unstable and not recommended. It may work sometimes, but expect crashes and Failed to get process base/Unable to find TaskScheduler/Variable scan failed errors.
